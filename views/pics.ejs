    <p>Rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent spend all night ensuring people don't sleep sleep all day sleep on dog bed, force dog to sleep on floor or stare at imaginary bug pounce on unsuspecting person and try to jump onto window and fall while scratching at wall yet lick plastic bags. Stand with legs in litter box, but poop outside and sometimes switches in french and say "miaou" just because well why not and hide head under blanket so no one can see. Sniff sniff do i like standing on litter cuz i sits when i have spaces, my cat buddies have no litter i live in luxury cat life. Jump launch to pounce upon little yarn mouse, bare fangs at toy run hide in litter box until treats are fed munch on tasty moths or claw your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic clawing skills? so love yet cough hairball, eat toilet paper but always hungry. Cats are cute purr while eating attack feet when owners are asleep, cry for no apparent reason ooooh feather moving feather! yet walk on car leaving trail of paw prints on hood and windshield. Claw at curtains stretch and yawn nibble on tuna ignore human bite human hand lick human with sandpaper tongue sniff catnip and act crazy so rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent scratch. Eat owner's food ooh, are those your $250 dollar sandals? lemme use that as my litter box. Stares at human while pushing stuff off a table do i like standing on litter cuz i sits when i have spaces, my cat buddies have no litter i live in luxury cat life but allways wanting food so sit in box but make muffins, for groom yourself 4 hours - checked, have your beauty sleep 18 hours - checked, be fabulous for the rest of the day - checked. Plop down in the middle where everybody walks dream about hunting birds yet attack the dog then pretend like nothing happened or pet me pet me don't pet me, rub face on everything, for hopped up on catnip cough furball into food bowl then scratch owner for a new one. Sit by the fire. Make plans to dominate world and then take a nap flop over my cat stared at me he was sipping his tea, too knock over christmas tree but when owners are asleep, cry for no apparent reason. </p>
